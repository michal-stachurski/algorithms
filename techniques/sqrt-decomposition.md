### Sqrt Decomposition

Square root decomposition â€” split the sequence into blocks of fixed size.

Splitting objects (e.g. vertices) into light and heavy.

Square root decomposition by the time of queries & rebuilding the structure (batch processing).

Mo's algorithm - processing queries in proper order and updating the answer by erasing/inserting new elements, see [sqrt decomposition](https://cp-algorithms.com/data_structures/sqrt_decomposition.html).

__TODO:__ Mo's on trees.

Strings - if the sum of lengths is __S__ then there are at most __sqrt(S)__ distinct lengths.

Birthday paradox & baby-step giant-step, see [discrete log](https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/discrete-log.html).
